The sudoku_wrong_*.txt files in the samples/ directory were added for use
in the isValid() method of the Sudoku class. They were adapted from correct solutions in the
following manner:

1. sudoku_wrong_easy.txt has one error in one of its lines;
2. sudoku_wrong_hard2.txt has one error in one of its columns;
3. sudoku_wrong_evil.txt has one error in one of its blocks.
